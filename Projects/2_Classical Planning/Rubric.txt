Experimental Results & Report


Criteria: 	

    Analyze the search complexity as a function of domain size, search algorithm, and heuristic.

Meets Specifications:
	
    Report includes a table or chart to analyze the number of nodes expanded against number of actions in the domain.

    and two heuristics with A* on air cargo problems 3 and 4
    Report includes at least a one paragraph discussion of these results that 
    analyzes the growth trends as the problem size increases

Criteria:

    Report answers all required questions
	
Meets Specifications:

    Submission includes a short answer to each of the following questions. 
    (A short answer should be at least 1-2 sentences at most a small paragraph.)

    Which algorithm or algorithms would be most appropriate for planning in a very restricted domain 
    (i.e., one that has only a few actions) and needs to operate in real time?

    Which algorithm or algorithms would be most appropriate for planning in very large domains 
    (e.g., planning delivery routes for all UPS drivers in the U.S. on a given day)

    Which algorithm or algorithms would be most appropriate for planning problems 
    where it is important to find only optimal plans?
